# AI Image Detection: CNN Models
Paris Bozzuti, Ronaldo Tineo and Akshay Anand

## Introduction
- For our final project for STAT362, Advanced Machine Learning, we are creating a well-tuned CNN model to identify images as either AI-generated or Human-Generated. 
- Data from Kaggle, AI vs. Human-Generated Images: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrasala79/ai-vs-human-generated-dataset/data?select=train_data

## Best Model

Our current highest performing model is model-attempts/mobile_net.ipynb with a validation accuracy of 0.9744840264320374. 

This is a MobileNetV2 model with fine tuning and pre-processing included.
